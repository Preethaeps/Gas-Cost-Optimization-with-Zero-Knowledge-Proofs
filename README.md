# Gas-Cost-Optimization-with-Zero-Knowledge-Proofs
 In an Ethereum-based healthcare consortium, stakeholders like hospitals, insurance companies, and patients interact via smart contracts to securely verify and share sensitive data. High gas costs arise due to computational needs. Optimizing gas usage while maintaining data privacy ensures a cost-effective and secure system.

 The project's objective is to develop a system that ensures the confidentiality of sensitive blood test results using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), enabling data validation without revealing actual test data. By integrating zk-SNARKs with Ethereum smart contracts, the system will provide secure and decentralized verification of blood test results while maintaining patient privacy. It also aims to optimize transaction gas costs in Ethereum-based healthcare consortia through efficient use of zk-SNARKs, reducing computational overhead. The solution will leverage blockchain for immutability and transparency while keeping costs manageable, and offer a user-friendly interface for both patients and healthcare providers.


# zk-SNARK Setup with ZoKrates

## Installation
Install ZoKrates on Ubuntu:
```bash
curl -LSfs get.zokrat.es | sh
```

## Writing the zk-SNARK Circuit
1. Write the circuit logic in a `.zok` file.
2. Compile the circuit:
   ```bash
   zokrates compile -i <filename>.zok
   ```

## Generating Proving and Verification Keys
Generate the keys:
```bash
zokrates setup
```
- **Proving Key:** For generating proofs.
- **Verification Key:** For verifying proofs.

## Computing the Witness
Provide the input values:
```bash
zokrates compute-witness -a <values>
```
Example:
```bash
zokrates compute-witness -a 100 150
```

## Generating the Proof
Generate the zk-SNARK proof:
```bash
zokrates generate-proof
```

## Exporting the Verifier
Export the Solidity verifier contract:
```bash
zokrates export-verifier
```

## Verifying the Proof
Verify the zk-SNARK proof on-chain:
```bash
zokrates verify
```

## Deployment and Integration

### Deploy the Verifier Using Remix IDE
1. Open Remix IDE.
2. Paste the `verifier.sol` contract.
3. Compile and deploy it using MetaMask.

### Front-End Integration
1. Build a front-end using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
2. Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the contract.
3. Users input data, generate zk-SNARK proofs, and verify them on the blockchain.
